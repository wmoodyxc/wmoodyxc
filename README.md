# William Moody
Hello, my name is William or Will. I am 20 years old.
## Computer Engineering
I was originally a Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati but decided to completely switch gears by going from UC to WSU.
Technically I am a 3rd Year but at this point I am aiming to graduate whenever I am ready.
## Projects
### Miscellaneous Websites
Many of these in all honesty are just stupid stuff I have done with friends, but I do enjoy maintaining them.
- üê∞ | https://mintyylol.github.io/bunny
    - Friend of mine has collected roughly 500 images of bunnies over the past couple of years. Decided to make a website that randomly generates one everytime you refresh the site.
- üêú | https://gamingpodcast.neocities.org/
    - I have little to no memory of making this site but me and my friends continue to add to it every once and a while, it is really dumb but I love it.

### Video Editing
I do not have really any examples at the moment but I edit videos in my free time, usually it is either synced to music, funny clips of me and my friends, or simply joke videos that don't really mean anything.
